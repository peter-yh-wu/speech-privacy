# Towards Client-side Privacy for Downstream Speech Tasks

Here is a [link](https://peter-yh-wu.github.io/speech-privacy-samples/) to our generated samples.

## Notes

 - [Link](https://github.com/jjery2243542/voice_conversion) to GAN voice conversion model.

 - [Link](https://github.com/jjery2243542/adaptive_voice_conversion) to VAE voice conversion model.

 - We used [REAPER](https://github.com/google/REAPER) and [Rubber Band](github.com/breakfastquay/rubberband) to build our signal processing approach. Details are described in our [paper](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~peterw1/website_files/privacy.pdf).

 - Run `src/main.py` to train the adversary classifier.
